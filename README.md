## Developer Help and Documentation

Service Fabric Explorer consists of two main components, an AngularJS based application (Sfx) and an Electron part to host the AngularJS application (Sfx-Standalone).

### Preparing the development machine

To develop Service Fabric Explorer, the following components are required.

* Git: https://git-scm.com/
* Python 2: https://www.python.org/
* Node.js (Latest is preferred): https://nodejs.org/
* C++ Compiler
   * Windows: Visual C++ https://www.visualstudio.com/
   * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential`

The recommended IDE for Service Fabric Explorer development is VSCode because VSCode is a cross-platform editor, which supports Windows, Linux and macOS. But you can use whatever editor to develop. 

Here's a list of common IDE used.
* VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
* Visual Studio: https://www.visualstudio.com/

### Set up the development environment

1. Clone the master branch.
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric-explorer.git <path to the local folder>`
2. Install project dependencies: *This can be done inside VSCode or use a console window.*
   1. [SFX] Navigate to `src/Sfx` and run the following scripts.
   ```Shell
   npm install   
   ```
   2. [SFX Standalone] Navigate to `src/Sfx-Standalone` and run the following scripts.
   ```Shell
   npm install
   ```
   3. [SFX Tests] Navigate to `test/SfxTests` and run the following scripts.
   ```Shell
   npm install   
   ```
   34. [SFX Proxy] Navigate to `src/Sfx-Proxy` and run the following scripts.
   ```Shell
   npm install   
   ```

3. Build projects
   * VSCode
      1. Open `src/Sfx`, `src/Sfx-Standalone` and `test/SfxTests` in VSCode with multiple-root workspce.
      2. Run following tasks orderly.
         * `clean-build` for Sfx
         * `clean-build` for Sfx-Standalone
         * `clean-build` for SfxTests
   * Console
      1. Install Gulp globally on the machine.
      ```Shell
      npm install gulp-cli -g
      ```
      2. [SFX] Navigate to `src/Sfx` and run the following scripts.
      ```Shell
      gulp clean-build
      ```
      3. [SFX Standalone] Navigate to `src/Sfx-Standalone` and run the following scripts.
      ```Shell
      gulp clean-build
      ```
      4. [SFX Tests] Navigate to `test/SfxTests` and run the following scripts.
      ```Shell
      gulp clean-build
      ```

### Run Local http server/Proxy
Navigate to `src/Sfx-Proxy`
```Shell
npm start
```

There are 2 optional flags
-r which would record every request to a folder(by default called playbackRecordings) and overwriting if the same request is made again
-p every request will be checked for a saved response and if one exists get served instead
```Shell
npm start -- -r -p
```

If proxying requests to a secure cluster the appsettings.json can also take a cert pfx location like
{
  "TargetCluster": {
    "Url": "https://jejarryacesstesting.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080",
    "PFXLocation": "C:/some_cert.pfx",
    "PFXPassPhrase": "password"
  },
  "recordFileBase": "playbackRecordings/"
}


### Run unit tests for Sfx

Open `test/SfxTests` in VSCode or Navigate to `test/SfxTests` in console and run the `ut` gulp task.
